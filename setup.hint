sdesc: "Character set converter (CLI)"
ldesc: "The Recode library converts files between character sets and 
usages. It recognises or produces over 200 different character sets (or 
about 300 if combined with an iconv library) and transliterates files 
between almost any pair. When exact transliteration are not possible, it 
gets rid of offending characters or falls back on approximations. The 
recode program is a handy front-end to the library."
